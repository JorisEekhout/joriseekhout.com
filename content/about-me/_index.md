I'm a postdoctoral researcher with a Juan de la Cierva fellowship in the [Soil and Water Conservation Research Group](http://www.soilwaterconservation.es) in CEBAS-CSIC (Murcia, Spain). Currently, I focus on the impact of climate change and landuse change on hydrology and soil erosion in Mediterranean environments. In the past years, I have developed a coupled hydrology-soil erosion model ([SPHY-MMF](https://github.com/JorisEekhout/SPHY/tree/SPHY2.1-MMF)), which I have applied in the Segura River catchment. The model is written in the [Python language](https://www.python.org/) and makes use of the [PC-Raster framework](http://pcraster.geo.uu.nl/). I did my PhD research at Wageningen University (The Netherlands), which focussed on morphodynamics of lowland streams. During my PhD I surveyed several lowland streams using GPS-equipment. Data obtained from the field I analysed in [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html), which I used to analyse data since my MSc thesis at Twente University. Since 2015, I started using [R](https://www.r-project.org/) as the main software tool to analyse data. In 2014 I started to become interested in web design. I have made several websites, for instance the current website of my research group.
