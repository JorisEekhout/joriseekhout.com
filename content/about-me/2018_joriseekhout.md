The current website is made in the static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). I got inspiration from the [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) R-package, which uses Hugo to generate the website. Hugo is especially convenient when the website consists of lists, such as publications, presentations and projects. Besides, I did a course on [Advanced CSS and SASS](https://www.udemy.com/advanced-css-and-sass/), which gave me inspiration for the design of the website.
