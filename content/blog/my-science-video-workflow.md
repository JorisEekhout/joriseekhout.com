title: "My Science Video Workflow"

**In this blog post I want to tell how I make my science videos. Although I don't have so much experience yet (with 4 finished videos), I do have developed a workflow, which I want to share here with you. Please check out all the video I have made thus far in the [Videos section](/videos/).**

After making several videos, I started to develop my own workflow. When I go to shoot the videos, I try to shoot a wide variety of videos. That includes some close-ups, some overview shots, some shots with people doing their field work, and if possible, some time-lapse and slow-mo videos. It is best to have too many videos, than too little. When I started making the videos, I wanted to make them not too long, but long enough to be able to tell a story. Now it happens that Twitter allows videos up to 2 minutes and 20 seconds (or 140 seconds, no idea where that number comes from) and that seems to be working perfectly for me. In most videos, I use something like 15 shots, that range from a 5-15 seconds. 

I first make a pre-selection of all the shots that are good enough for the video. The shots that do not make the cut can have the following mistakes: my shadow is in the shot (pro tip!), are to shaky (although you can correct for that, more on that later on),
