summary = "This is a video abstract of the SPHY-MMF coupled hydrology-soil erosion model. The video describes the most relevant processes handled by the model, such as the hydrological processes, soil erosion and sediment transport. The model is well-suited to perform scenario assessments at regional scales and over decadal periods, most relevant for policy makers."
