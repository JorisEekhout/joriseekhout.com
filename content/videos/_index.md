In 2018 I started making short videos for my research group, with the aim to show the field sites where we do our research. Most videos I made with a GoPro camera and were edited in [Davinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve). Most videos are made with English and Spanish text, to increase the understanding for the local Spanish audience. We publish the videos in our [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/CEBAS_SWC) and on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzjl81pDD5e7a5vA6vv_Z8Q).
