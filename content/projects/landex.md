Nature-based solutions (NBS) have the potential to be a cost-effective climate change adaptation strategy, however, they can only be effectively implemented when local stakeholders are considered, as well. This project aimed to assess their potential in five case studies within Europe and to apply a common research strategy to co-design climate change adaptation strategies and assess their potential using hydrological models. The case studies are performed in five countries, including Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and The Netherlands. I acted as Work Package leader for WP4, which focusses on the application of hydrological models in the different case studies.
