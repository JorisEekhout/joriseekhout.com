In this technical support contract I acted along with Joris de Vente as co-IP. In collaboration with FutureWater we prepared a manual and tutorial to apply the SPHY-MMF model in Madagascar. I specifically focused on the sensitivity analysis and calibration of the model. During the training I gave a presentation on the application of Sustainable Land Management scenarios in the Segura River catchment in southeast Spain.
