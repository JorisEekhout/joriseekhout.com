In this technical support contract I acted along with Joris de Vente as co-IP. In this project we studied the feasibility of using reservoir altimeter data from remote sensing to calibrate hydrological models. We applied the proposed method in a small subcatchment of the Segura River catchment. The results were published in a report, see below. Furthermore, in this project we updated the SPHY model code, which is published as SPHY v3.0. The model can be downloaded from the [SPHY Github repository](https://github.com/FutureWater/SPHY). The new model code includes two new modules (soil erosion and sediment transport) and improvements related to glacier processes, plant water stress, open-water evaporation and surface runoff. Furthermore, the structure of the model was changed to facilitate future model development.
