In 2017 I was awarded a Juan de la Cierva fellowship, which is a 2-year postodoctoral grant from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness. During the coming two years I will follow with the research I started in 2015, in the [ADAPT project](/projects/adapt/). One of the aims is to couple a hydraulic model to the soil erosion model we developed in the past years.
