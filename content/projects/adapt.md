In 2015 I started as a postdoctoral researcher at the Soil and Water Conservation Research Group at CEBAS-CSIC. We studied the catchment-scale impact of climate change on hydrology and soil erosion in a semi-arid Mediterranean catchment. Next, we studied climate change adaptation through large scale implementation of Sustainable Land Management (SLM). During this project we developed a new proces-based soil erosion model. We coupled an existing soil erosion model (Morgan-Morgan-Finney) to a hydrological model ([SPHY](https://www.sphy.nl/)). The model code of the new model can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/FutureWater/SPHY).
