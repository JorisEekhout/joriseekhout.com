The [COASTAL project](https://h2020-coastal.eu/) is a European research and innovation project, with partners and case studies in Belgium, Greece, Sweden, France, Romania and Spain. The [Soil and Water Conservation Research Group](http://www.soilwaterconservation.es/) is the leading partner in the Mar Menor case study. In this project we will organize and engage local stakeholders, such as farmers from the Campo de Cartagena area, ecologists, scientists and hotel owners from La Manga. These stakeholders will work together in a so-called Multi-Actor Lab to evaluate business solutions and policy recommendations.
