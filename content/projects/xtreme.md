Nature-based solutions (NBS) have the potential to be a cost-effective climate change adaptation strategy. This project aimed to assess their potential in a large semi-arid catchment in southeast Spain. The most suitable NBS were selected using a stakeholder consultation approach. We developed a channel module for the SPHY model, which aimed to assess the potential of stream restoration as a NBS. Furthermore, other NBS were implemented on the hillslopes, which showed how NBS can mitigate future flood events.
