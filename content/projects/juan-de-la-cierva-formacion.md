In 2017 I was awarded a Juan de la Cierva-Formación fellowship, which is a 2-year postodoctoral grant from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness. During this period, I further developed the SPHY model and applied the model to several case studies, including a study on the impact of land use and climate change on ecosystem services indicators in the Segura River catchment. I also started a new research line, which focussed on the methodologies used in climate change impact assessments on soil erosion.
