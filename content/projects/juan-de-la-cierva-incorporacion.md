In 2022 I was awarded a Juan de la Cierva-Incorporación fellowship, which is a 3-year postodoctoral grant from the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation. During this period I continued the research I started in the [XTREME project](/projects/xtreme/). This included the application of the SPHY model, including the novel channel module, to a series of case studies. Moreover, I started a new research line with a focus on large-scale impacts of climate and land use change on water resources in the Mediterranean Basin.
