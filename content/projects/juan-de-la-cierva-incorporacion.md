In 2022 I was awarded a Juan de la Cierva-Incorporación fellowship, which is a 3-year postodoctoral grant from the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation. During the coming three years I will continue the research I started in the [XTREME project](/projects/xtreme/). This will include the application of the SPHY model, including the novel channel module, to a series of case studies.
